# TrackWise Summary

TrackWise provides a quick and easy way for small manufacturing companies to track turnover and issues that create downtime. A common workplace issue is miscommunication, which happens often with both shifts and management. When a department's team starts their shift, they may not know what issues the previous shift faced and what equipment may or may not be functioning correctly. Management may also remain unaware that the team's production has halted.

This application provides software that allows departments and shifts to record all of the issues they face, including the cause of the issue and how long it has affected the team. The teams will gain the benefit of knowing what kind of issues the previous eam faced, and what may affect their team during their daily operations.
