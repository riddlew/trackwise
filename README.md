# Capstone Summary
The application targets a fictional manufacturing company that does not have a system in place for the manufacturing departments to track turnover and issues that stop production and create downtime. Without this application, misommunication is a common problem that both shifts and management face. When a department's team starts their shift, they may not know what issues the previous shift faced and what equipment may or may not be functioning correctly. Management may also remain unaware that the team's production has halted.

This application provides software that allows departments and shifts to record all of the issues they face, including the cause of the issue and how long it has affected the team. The teams will gain the benefit of knowing what kind of issues the previous eam faced, and what may affect their team during their daily operations.
